const name = "prit"  // this is 1st method of declaring a string
const repoCount = 50

// console.log(name + repoCount + " Value"); => this is old method of concatinating a string

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repoCount}`); // This is new way of concatinating a string it is called as string interpolation

const gameName = new String('pritzzz')  // this is 2nd method of declaring string
